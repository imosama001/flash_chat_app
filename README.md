# flash_chat_app

A group messaging app inspired by having a personal group without any privacy threat.<br />
GIving users a perfect group chatting experience with tons of upcoming features like chat in private mode (no name visible, can be seen by admin in urgent or emergency case, but there must be some rules), polls, split bills, send money through UPI, create new groups, multiple groups with different people and for different purpose.<br />
And many more ideas are cooking .......

## Getting started
Fork this repository and add firebase config file, and you are good to go.<br />

### Current features in app:
Register with email and password<br />
Login with email and password<br />
Themes (light mode and dark mode)<br />
Send text messages<br />
Delete messages within a time limit<br />
Reply to messages<br />
Usernames are not visible (and it is a feature, we'll implement method to make it optional)<br />
Different messages bubble colors for different users (same for a session, and changes randomly on re-opening app)<br />
Any group member can delete all messages with a given password / code (user who had deleted all messages, their details will be logged)<br />
